Testing Environment Configuration
=================================

Testing via TravisCI
--------------------

``bok-choy`` can be used along with Travis CI to test changes remotely.
One way to accomplish this testing is to use the headless version of Chrome or Firefox.
bok-choy does this when the ``BOKCHOY_HEADLESS`` environment is set to "true".

.. code-block:: yaml

    before_script:
      - export BOKCHOY_HEADLESS=true

Another option is to use the X Virtual Framebuffer (xvfb) to imitate a display.
Headless versions of Chrome and Firefox are relatively new developments,
so you may want to use xvfb if you encounter a bug with headless browser usage.
To use xvfb, you'll start it up via a ``before_script`` section in your ``.travis.yml`` file, like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    before_script:
      - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
      - "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"
      - sleep 3 # give xvfb some time to start

For more details, see this code example_ and the Travis_ docs.

Testing via tox
---------------

``bok-choy`` can be used along with tox to test against multiple Python virtual environments containing different versions of requirements.

An important detail when using tox in a Travis CI environment: tox passes along only a fixed list of environment variables to each tox-created virtual environment.
When using ``bok-choy`` via xvfb in tox, the DISPLAY environment variable is needed but is not automatically passed-in.
The tox.ini file needs to specify the DISPLAY variable like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [testenv]
    passenv =
        DISPLAY

For more details, see the tox_ docs.
